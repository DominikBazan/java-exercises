The bakery makes two types of cakes: vanilla and chocolate. They now want to make more complex cakes such as a "Multi-layered Vanilla cake with sprinkles that says 'Hello World!'"

Write the code so that an order can contain such complex cakes using the Decorator Pattern:

Create the necessary decorator classes:
For multi-layered cakes, add $5 and print "Multi-layered" out at the front of the name.
For sprinkles, add $2 and print "with sprinkles" at the end of the name.
For a cake with the saying X, add nothing to the cost, and print "with saying 'X'" at the end of the name.
Add the new type of cake: strawberry cake, which costs $14.
Change the client to add the following to an Order, and print the Order:
Chocolate cake
Vanilla cake with saying 'PLAIN!'
Vanilla cake with sprinkles with saying 'FANCY'
Multi-layered Strawberry cake with double sprinkles and two sayings 'One of' and 'EVERYTHING'
Suggested output is: Multi-layered Strawberry cake with sprinkles with sprinkles with saying 'One of' with saying 'EVERYTHING'
